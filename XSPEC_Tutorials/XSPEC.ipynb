    "## Choosing the model and fitting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "XSPEC has a large number of predefined models. To see the list of models, use the command `model` or `mo`. There are three types of models: `additive`, `multiplicative`, and `other`. The `additive` models are added to the source spectrum, the `multiplicative` models are multiplied to the source spectrum, and the `other` models are convolution models, Mixin models, and Pile-up models.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For example, to use the power-law model, use the command \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    mo TBabs*po\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Here, `TBabs` is the absorption model and `po` is the power-law model. The model `TBabs` requires the Hydrogen column density ($nH$) as a parameter in the units of $10^{22} cm^{-2}$. \n",

    "2. When the command `mo TBabs*po` is executed, input the values of the parameters such as `nH`, `phoindex`, `norm`. To freeze a parameter, add -1 at the end of the parameter value. Once the values are input, a summary of the model is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the command `query yes` to ensure the fitting continues without any questions being asked. Use the command `renorm` to adjust the normalization of the model to the data which is chosen to minimize the fit statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To fit the data, use the command `fit`. One can also add number of iterations to the fit command to get a better fit. For example, `fit 100` will fit the data 100 times. Once the fit is performed, the output shows the best-fit parameters and the fit statistic. The reduced $\\chi^2$ value for this fit is more than 2 and thus it is not a good fit.\n",
