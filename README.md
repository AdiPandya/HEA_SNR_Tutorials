# HEA_SNR_Tutorials
*by Aditya Pandya*

Tutorials for High Energy Astrophysics study of Supernova Remnants (SNRs) using XSPEC and eROSITA data analysis. It can also be used for general X-ray spectral analysis and eROSITA data analysis.

## Contents

### 1. [XSPEC](XSPEC_Tutorials/)
This directory contains tutorials that walk you through using **[XSPEC](XSPEC_Tutorials/XSPEC.ipynb)** for X-ray spectral analysis. It includes:

- Loading and modifying data
- Plotting spectra
- Defining models
- Performing fits
- Visualizing results
- Handling background modeling

Additionally, it contains a tutorial on **[PyXspec](XSPEC_Tutorials/PyXSPEC.ipynb)**, a Python interface for XSPEC. PyXspec simplifies using XSPEC within a Python environment, allowing for more flexible and automated analysis and visualization. 

### 2. [eROSITA data analysis using eSASS](eROSITA_eSASS_Tutorials/)
This directory contains tutorials that guide you through using the eROSITA Science Analysis Software System (eSASS) for analyzing eROSITA data. It includes:

- Setting up the data
- **[Data reduction by filtering out flares](eROSITA_eSASS_Tutorials/01_Introduction_and_Setup.ipynb)**
- **[Creating images](eROSITA_eSASS_Tutorials/Imaging/02_Imaging_tutorial.ipynb)**
- **[Extracting spectra](eROSITA_eSASS_Tutorials/Spectra/)**

It also includes Python scripts for these tasks, which can be used to automate the analysis process. The tutorials provide step-by-step instructions on each step of the script, allowing for understanding and modification according to your needs. For more details, refer to the **[README](eROSITA_eSASS_Tutorials/README.md)** file in this directory.

##### Note: More tutorials will be added in the future to cover more aspects of X-ray spectral analysis and eROSITA data analysis.
